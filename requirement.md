# üõ†Ô∏è Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## WiFi Deauthentication Tool ‚Äì Kali Linux

**Prepared for:** Cybersecurity Research / Penetration Testing
**Prepared by:** \[Your Name or Team]
**Date:** July 16, 2025

## üîç 1. Overview

### 1.1 Purpose

The WiFi Deauthentication Tool is a command-line utility for Kali Linux that allows cybersecurity professionals and ethical hackers to simulate WiFi deauthentication attacks. It helps test the robustness of wireless networks by sending forged deauth packets to clients, forcing disconnections.

### 1.2 Target Users

* Ethical hackers
* Penetration testers
* Cybersecurity researchers
* Network administrators

### 1.3 Use Case

To assess WiFi network security by observing how access points and clients respond to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks using deauthentication frames.

---

## üß™ 2. Functional Requirements

### 2.1 Scanning Networks

* Scan all nearby WiFi access points.
* List BSSIDs, SSIDs, channels, and number of clients.

### 2.2 Client Detection

* Select an access point (AP) and list connected clients with MAC addresses.

### 2.3 Deauthentication Attack

* Send deauth frames to:

  * A specific client
  * All clients connected to the AP
* Number of packets to send (customizable)
* Packet interval configuration

### 2.4 Monitoring & Logging

* Real-time logging of deauth packets sent.
* Save logs for future analysis.

### 2.5 Command-Line Interface (CLI)

* Minimal and easy-to-use CLI with options like:

  ```bash
  ./deauth-tool.py --interface wlan0 --bssid XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX --client YY:YY:YY:YY:YY:YY --packets 100
  ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è 3. Non-Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Performance

* Real-time response (low latency packet injection)
* Support multiple attacks in parallel

### 3.2 Security

* Require root privileges
* Include a disclaimer to prevent misuse

### 3.3 Portability

* Compatible with Kali Linux (latest version)
* Python 3.x based with dependencies like `scapy`, `airmon-ng`

### 3.4 Usability

* CLI help (`--help`) with clear instructions
* Color-coded console output

---

## üõ†Ô∏è 4. Technical Requirements

### 4.1 System Requirements

* OS: Kali Linux
* Wireless Card: Monitor mode & packet injection support
* Python 3.x

### 4.2 Tools/Dependencies

* `aircrack-ng` suite (for monitor mode)
* `scapy` for crafting and sending packets
* `os`, `argparse`, `time`, `logging` libraries

### 4.3 Example Tech Stack

* Language: Python
* Packet Injection: `scapy`
* Interface Setup: `airmon-ng` or `iwconfig`

## ‚úÖ 5. Ethical Use and Disclaimer

This tool is **strictly for educational and authorized testing purposes only.** Unauthorized use on networks you do not own or have permission to test is illegal and unethical.
Include a mandatory acceptance prompt before launching the tool:

```text
[!] WARNING: This tool is for authorized testing only. 
By continuing, you confirm you have permission to test the target network.
Do you agree? (yes/no):
```

---

## üì¶ 6. Deliverables

* `deauth-tool.py` (main script)
* `README.md` with usage instructions
* License file (GPLv3 or MIT)
* `requirements.txt`
* Optional: GUI version using `tkinter` or `CustomTkinter`

---

## üìà 8. Future Enhancements

* Add GUI with attack controls
* Log visualization with charts
* Integrate WPA handshake capture
* Auto-detection of vulnerable clients (e.g., hidden SSIDs)
